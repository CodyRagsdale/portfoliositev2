## Introduction

Welcome to my Portfolio Site Version 2! This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The site showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a software developer.

## Background

This project serves as a milestone, marking how far I've come since my initial steps into the world of coding. My first portfolio was a fledgling attempt, built during my first month of diving into programming. Rather than reviving that initial project, I decided to build this portfolio from scratch as a testament to my growth and evolution as a developer.
